The ""SHG Imaging"" settings had ""UV-TPEF"" sensor selected. It seems it had been selected by mistake for some reason.
Changed it to ""SHG"". Imaged the user plate to make sure the images looked like SHG images.
Sent update to Sarah.

Safdar received email from Merck team saying that plate was stuck halfway between PSR and imager module arm. They tried restarting the imager services twice, but the UI is stuck on diagnostics.

I emailed them asking for the log files. They replied with the log files and expressed grievance with how it has been over a month now and they cannot use the imager for more than '24-48 hours without a crash event occurring'. 

Looking at the log files, Formulatrix Integration Services (FIS) does not appear to be running, which could be the reason why the UI is stuck on the diagnostics screen. Will need to visit on site ASAP, especially since getting remote access/scheduling zoom call for remote access is tricky.

I have reviewed the knowledge base, gathered the information, drafted an email, and sent it to the customer. In the email, I asked whether the issue persists with the CF chip or HV/LV only. Additionally, I requested the customer to perform a pneumatic check.

I have conducted two sessions for the site. During the first session, Paul was unavailable to take the database backup, so we rescheduled for later that same day. Once the backup was taken, I upgraded to the beta version of Rockmaker V4.7. After the upgrade, the team checked the images, and everything was working. However, they later faced an issue in Rockimager, which Safdar was able to resolve.
